# NordInvasion theme for Vanilla Forums

Repo for testing out transitioning the mybb styles of the existing forum to the proposed Vanilla Forums.

## Notes

* Move is not guaranteed.
* Theme is currently not complete.
* Intention is likely to make it similar to existing forum solutions, rather than vanilla's layout.
* Theme is originally for NI. You are welcome to fork.
* There are no guarantees offered regarding compatibility or whatever we choose to do.
* Team discussions will not appear on GitHub.
* Changes may happen at any time for any reason.
